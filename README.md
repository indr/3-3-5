Easy navigation using a simple content structure, 3 3 5 users can listen to over 10,000 online radio stations as well as media on the device. It is ad free and supported by its users.

The application provides two high contrast interfaces:

A simple list interface that comes with a freely adjustable font size to make it comfortable to use for vision challenged and users with poor or low eyesight. This interface is also optimized for screen readers such has Googles TalkBack.

The second interface only consists of a simple buttons layout and can be used eyeless. Navigating through, exploring and enjoying content is made accessible through touch exploration and spoken feedback.
